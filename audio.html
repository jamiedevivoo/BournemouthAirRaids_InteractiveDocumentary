            <h4>Summary</h4>
            	<p>
					Ron Jenkinson was born in Bournemouth in 1933. He was playing outside the front of the house with his brother at the time. It was lunchtime, the town was teeming, people were just getting ready for have their sunday roast. It was likely that these attacks were carefully planned, strategic raids were carried out by pilots who were experienced in attacking at high speed. Despite being three to four miles away from the central attacks, Ron was able to hear the bombs land. He later learned that the Metropole was attacked which housed several canadian soldiers who were killed. His childhood consisted of watching the dog fights that occured in the skies above him, witnessing plane engines on fire and crashing to the ground. 
				</p>
				<p>
					George Perrin was born in Portsmouth in 1932. As a child he was evacuated and forced to live with a lady who he despised, and who did not treat him well shortly after moving to bournemouth. Like Ron, George was able to hear the explosions which occured miles away. Him and his friend went on their bikes to ride down to the Metropole where they witnessed the awful damage of the bombings. Despite the dead bodies being moved, the carnage still remained.

					“It did have quite an effect …because there were a lot of Canadians there that were trying to help us during the war. I think it brought the 2 countries closer together really, because the Bournemouth people all had a lot of consideration for the Canadians that got killed, and a lot of respect. So I think it helped in that way, but it was a tragedy anyway. I think it did cement relations. People felt a lot of sympathy for the Canadians after this happened…”

            <h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>
            	John Creswell was only four in 1943 when the Metropole bombings began. He was just a child, sitting in his back garden when he witnessed planes fly across the skyline. There had been no air raid warning, but him and a few others decided to immediately go to the raid shelter. After staying some time, they eventurally left and could see smoke rise from Bournemouth center. He recounts it being one of the worst sights anyone could have witnessed. Most of the air raids would be at night time, and so as a child he was not concious of a mid-day attack. This event in partiuclar had a deep affect on John, as he can still remember the bombings vividly today. The main attack which is widely remembered is of the Metropole hotel, however 24 other bombs had also been dropped, causing wide-spread destruction across bournemouth. As a historian, his research found that the pilots had a plan of places they targetted to bomb, all of them being large buildings where many people were present. This bombings still resonate today with the reminders of war torn buildings.

				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>
					Sunday May 23 1943 was perhaps the worst day of the war in Bournemouth. A squadron of the Luftwaffe’s Focke Wulfes had bombed the town, leading to a terrible loss of life in just a few minutes. It is estimated that the number killed in Bournemouth on that day ranged from 70 to 200 people, with the addtion of twenty two destroyed buildings and a further 3,354 damaged. Mike Brown was just six years old when the bombs hit, whilst his father was away fighting at the war. He was playing with his friend when the sirens began, but due to the frequent nature of them he continued playing. It was not until the sound of the bombs could be felt and heard that he decided to run into the house, shortly after his mother had been calling for him. The buildings targeted that day included Cairns House; West’s Cinema; the Metropole Hotel at the Lansdowne; the Central Hotel at Richmond Hill; the Shamrock and Rambler coach station at Holdenhurst Road; and Beales department store. There had been incidents before, a total of 47. Bombs had been dropped, leading to devisation across bournemouth, but it had not been as horrific as the events that unfolded on 23 May 1943. It is a day that few will forget.

            	<p>
					Vernon Masterman had always lived in Bournemouth, and remained in his childhood house even after it had been damaged from Bournemouth bombings in 1943. He was a mere 4 and a half years old when he was playing in his backyard lawn whilst his father was gardening and mother cooking the sunday roast. After hearing loud noises, he looked up to find a large group of planes flying overhead. His mother came and grabbed his arm, rushing towards the air raid shelter that was further down the street. They didnt make it to the shelter as they were stopped by flying debris from a blast at the side of the neighbouring building. They were trapped under the building for hours whilst they waited to be dug out. The bomb was aimed at the nerby railway bridge, but had ricochet across the town before detonating next door. Ever sincee these harrowing events, the smell of rubble and burnt building structures still remind him of the day those many years ago. Being a child, his memories of the war were an adventure, he had no fear. Despite the awful events, Vernon still remembers the fun he had across the area as a child, but the reminders of the war still remain.
