				<h4>Summary</h4>
					<p>
						Ron Jenkinson was born in Bournemouth in 1933. He was playing outside the front of the house with his brother at the time. It was lunchtime, the town was teeming, people were just getting ready for have their sunday roast. It was likely that these attacks were carefully planned, strategic raids were carried out by pilots who were experienced in attacking at high speed. Despite being three to four miles away from the central attacks, Ron was able to hear the bombs land. He later learned that the Metropole was attacked which housed several canadian soldiers who were killed. His childhood consisted of watching the dog fights that occured in the skies above him, witnessing plane engines on fire and crashing to the ground. 
					</p>
					<p>
						George Perrin was born in Portsmouth in 1932. As a child he was evacuated and forced to live with a lady who he despised, and who did not treat him well shortly after moving to bournemouth. Like Ron, George was able to hear the explosions which occured miles away. Him and his friend went on their bikes to ride down to the Metropole where they witnessed the awful damage of the bombings. Despite the dead bodies being moved, the carnage still remained.

						I lived in Ensbury Park in the North Western corner of Bournemouth. I remember playing out in the drive with my brother at the time. I remember the violent explosions, even at 3-4 miles away. We later learned that it was the Metropole Hotel, and that load of Canadian soldiers had been killed.

						I feel like that raid did have quite an effect on all of us; there were a lot of Canadians staying in the Metropole that were trying to help us during the war. So in a way I think it brought the two countries closer together really. The Bournemouth people all had a lot of consideration and respect for the Canadians that got killed. So I suppose it helped in that way, but it was a tragedy. I think it did cement relations, people felt a lot of sympathy for the Canadians after this happened.

						Now this didn't take place on the 23rd of May but it does help to paint a picture of wartime Bournemouth. I remember the Alma Road School. One night my dad was on ARP duty and he came running in and said “There’s a landmine coming down”. When that hit that was a terrific explosion and that was 2 miles away from where we were and that flattened the school and damaged many of the buildings in the area. Can you imagine the chaos caused by loads of them dropping. Especially during the day, that's why the Metropole was so devastating.

						I was used to seeing planes flying through Bournemouth. I remember we used to watch fighter planes dog fights over Bournemouth, with planes you couldn't always see them, but you could always hear the machine guns constantly going. I used to go out as a child to Hurn Airport and I’d sit on the end of the runway and watch the bombers come in from Berlin.

							I can remember the raid on the metropolitan hotel, very well. I could hear the explosion from where I lived on the Ringwood Road. My mate and I, a chap named Johnny Doe, jumped on our bikes and rode down to the Metropole and saw the damage and it was horrendous. The bodies were moved but you could still see the carnage of what had happened down there.

						It didn’t affect me, I wasn’t frightened, I wasn’t that type of person. The bombs used to make me jump when they went off, but I just accepted it, I wasn’t scared at all. It was just one of those things that we had to deal with, that didn't change throughout the war.
